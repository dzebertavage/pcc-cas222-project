            <h3>Sprint</h3>
            <p>Course will offer a 1-loop 1/2 mile swim, the exact same 28 mile Bike Course as the Olympic distance and a 5km run.</p>

            <p>This novice race is designed for the first time triathlete, those new to the sport, our Junior Triathletes. The swim is a shorter, more manageable 1/4 mile distance, (instead of the standard 1/2-mile Sprint distance swim), 10 mile bike ride (vs 12 miles and it's a 2 loop course making it very spectator friendly!) and a flat 2 mile run (vs 3 mile sprint course).</p>
            <h3>Half Marathon</h3>
            <p>Half-Marathon event starts and finishes in the Athletes Village to the cheers of the enthusiastic crowd. Once finished, runners can enjoy the finish line festivities, including the Sports &amp; Fitness Expo and live entertainment. Post-race refreshments will be provided and the Awards Ceremony for the Half-Marathon will begin once the results have been certified.</p>
            <h3>10K</h3>
            <p>The 10K event starts and finishes in the Athletes Village. The paths are approximately 6 ft wide, perfectly paved and wind around through the forest. Each course has only two small hills with a minimal elevation gain to navigate and a fast downhill to flat finish to the roaring cheers of the crowd.</p>
            <h3>Splash 'n' Dash</h3>
            <p>Kids event for participants ages 4 to 15. This is a 100 yard swim and a 50 yard dash. It is free if an adult registers for an event otherwise it is $25.</p>
